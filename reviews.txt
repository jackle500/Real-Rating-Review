   I love this product! It's amazing and the best thing ever.
   This is the worst purchase I've made.
   It's okay, not great but not bad either.
My husband has been wanting an Apple Watch for a while. I decided to torture him with this one when it went on sale and he Hate IT! He never wears it for work. The battery life is Terrible and it’s very annoying to wear according to him. The screen size is too small and it looks terrible on. It’s super easy to pair and it’s definitely a great watch for the price. Very very happy with my purchase. DO NOT BUY it
